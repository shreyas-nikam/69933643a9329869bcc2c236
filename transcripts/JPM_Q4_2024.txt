OPERATOR: Welcome to the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.
JAMIE DIMON: Good morning, everyone. We concluded 2024 with record earnings, reflecting the strength of our diversified business model. For the fourth quarter of 2024, net revenue was $40.5 billion, up 10% from the prior year, exceeding expectations of $39.8 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $3.98, compared to $3.57 in Q4 2023, well above consensus estimates of $3.75. Our net interest income (NII) grew by 18%. We saw continued strength in our consumer and community banking segment. We are actively managing credit risk given the evolving economic environment. We are raising our guidance for full-year 2025 NII to approximately $90 billion, from our previous guidance of $88 billion. Our expenses were $22.5 billion, higher than expected due to investments in technology. We are confident in our capital position and continued growth trajectory.
ANALYST 1: Jamie, could you comment on the expense growth?
JAMIE DIMON: We are making strategic investments that we believe will drive long-term value.
