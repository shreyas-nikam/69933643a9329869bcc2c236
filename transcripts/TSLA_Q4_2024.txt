OPERATOR: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Tesla, Inc. Q4 2024 Earnings Q&A Webcast.
ELON MUSK: Thanks. Q4 2024 was a pivotal quarter for Tesla. We achieved revenue of $27.0 billion, a 20% increase year-over-year, which was in line with analyst expectations. Our diluted earnings per share came in at $0.95, slightly below the $1.00 consensus estimate. Automotive gross margin was 17.5%, down from 20% a year ago, primarily due to price reductions. We expect to see continued pressure on margins in the near term as we scale production of Cybertruck. Our energy storage business saw significant growth, with deployments up 45%. We are lowering our guidance for vehicle deliveries in 2025 due to global supply chain challenges and economic uncertainty. We now project 2025 deliveries to be around 1.8 million units, a decrease from our prior forecast of 2.0 million units. We are accelerating our AI and robotics initiatives.
ANALYST 1: Elon, about the margin pressure, how will that impact profitability?
ELON MUSK: We are focused on cost efficiency and innovation.
