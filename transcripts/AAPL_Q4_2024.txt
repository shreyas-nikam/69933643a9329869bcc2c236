OPERATOR: Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q4 2024 Earnings Conference Call.
TIM COOK: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We finished a record-breaking fiscal 2024 with a strong September quarter. We delivered September quarter revenue of $90.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year. This growth was driven by continued strong performance in our Services segment, which grew 15% to $22.3 billion, and resilience in iPhone sales. We saw robust demand for our new iPhone 16 models. Our diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.40, compared to $1.35 in the prior year. This was above analyst consensus of $1.38. Our operating margin was 38.5%, an increase of 100 basis points YoY. We are seeing some macroeconomic headwinds in certain geographies, particularly in Europe, which we are closely monitoring. We expect December quarter revenue to be between $117 billion and $122 billion. Our guidance for fiscal year 2025 revenue is maintained at $390 billion to $400 billion. We remain confident in our long-term strategy.
LUCA MAESTRI: Thanks, Tim. Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong. We returned over $29 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the September quarter.
ANALYST 1: Tim, can you elaborate on the European headwinds?
TIM COOK: Yes, we are seeing some softness, but believe our product pipeline remains strong.
ANALYST 2: What about the Q1 2025 EPS guidance?
LUCA MAESTRI: We typically do not provide specific quarterly EPS guidance, but we are confident in our full-year outlook.
